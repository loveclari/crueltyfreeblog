            <h1>PRISM 20% AHA + 5% BHA Exfoliating </br>Glow Facial</h1>
            <h2>Transforms skin from dull to radiant and glowing in only 10 minutes. Does it work?</h2>
            <p>Treat your skin to a brightening facial experience powered by a 20% concentrate of exfoliating and softening fruit-based Glycolic, Lactic, Tartaric, and Malic AHAs and 5% clarifying Willow Bark extract BHA to reduce the appearance of pores.A hydrating gel of Aloe Vera and Rosewater restores moisture. My skincare routine: Pink Cloud, Lapis (have used this blessed oil for years), and all forms of Prism. I actually use this miracle-mask-serum much more than the recommended use. It is incredibly powerful, so I do suggest started out with small amounts and only a few minutes. Now, I typically leave it on overnight.</p>
            <p>I had acne for many years and currently deal with the aftermath of scarring (both red + pitted scars) and uneven skin tone. I still feel the occasional impending blemish, but when I apply Prism to the area (and leave it on overnight), 99% I will wake up to either no blemish at all or an incredibly diminished state of the blemish. Additionally, this powerful serum evens out my skin tone, shrinks my pores, gives me an opalescent glow, and a boost of confidence to boot. I will never go without this miracle glow product!</p>  
            <p>I bought this on a whim, because I LOVE chemical peels. This mask will make your skin glow!!! However, if you have sensitive, easily reddened skin I do recommend wearing it for only about 5 minutes vs the 10 it recommends when starting off with this mask. It genuinely feels like the peels they give you at a spa and the results look just about the same!! 100/10</p>
