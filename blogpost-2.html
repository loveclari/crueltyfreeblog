        <h1>Blue Tansy Invisible Pores Resurfacing Clarity Mask</h1>
        <h2>A truly natural mask that gently clarifies acne-prone skin with Fruit Enzyme. Does it work?</h2>
        <p>I have blemish prone, combination skin. When I started using it, my face was covered in hormonal acne (~12 distinct bumps) along my jaw and cheeks. After using it the first night, I noticed existing acne was noticeably less red and no new acne formed. Every night I used it, my acne became less and less noticeable - by the 4th use, my face was clear for the first time in years!! I now continue to use it as directed (2-3 times a week) and my skin is stays blemish free 95% of the time (an improvement from 0% of the time).</p>
        <p>I hadn't changed anything else in my skin routine during this time, so I know this mask is the reason for my clearer, smoother skin. It's become the most essential skin product I own.</p>  
        <p>This mask is simply &amp; brilliantly made. Follow the directions for the first week or two &amp; then about two-three times a week thereafter. Using this mask (along with a sulphur spot mask when needed) has, quite literally, changed my face. I&rsquo;m (like ~98% blemish free) clear faced &amp; beaming. My skin just LOVES this mask &amp; when I get asked what makeup I use to have such a porcelain complexion- this is what I tell them about because......</p>    
        <p>I no longer use face makeup! Just illuminating SPF.</p>
        <p>Thank you Herbivore!!!!</p>
